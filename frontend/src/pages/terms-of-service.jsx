          all the latest news, promos, and other cool stuff we drop from time to
          time.
        </li>

        <li>
          Giveaways and Cool StuffAny contests or giveaways we throw down may
          have their own set of rules. Check those out, along with our Privacy
          Policy, if you decide to jump in. If there's any clash, the promo
          rules got your back.
        </li>
        <li>
          Subs and PaymentsSome parts of our Service come with a subscription
          fee. You'll be billed upfront, either every month or once a year,
          depending on your vibe. Unless you or we decide to cut ties, your sub
          will auto-renew. Wanna cancel? Hit up your Account or drop us a line
          at info@urbanchat.ai. Make sure your payment info is on point, and by
          sharing it, you're cool with us charging you for the sub. If the auto
          billing doesn't go through, we'll hit you up to sort it manually.
          Heads up, we might refuse or cancel orders for a bunch of reasons, and
          you gotta handle any extra fees or taxes your country throws at you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Price ChangesWe might switch up the Subscription fees now and then.
          We'll give you a heads up so you can decide if you wanna bounce before
          the new price kicks in. If you stick around, it means you're cool with
          the new price.
        </li>
        <li>
          No RefundsJust so you know, we don't do refunds on Subscription fees
          unless the law says we gotta.
        </li>
        <li>
          Share Your StuffOur Service lets you post and share all kinds of
          content. Just make sure it's all good with the law and you have the
          rights to share it. We can shut down accounts that mess with
          copyrights. You keep the rights to your stuff, but you gotta protect
          it. We're not responsible for anything you or others post.
        </li>

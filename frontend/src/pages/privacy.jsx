        <h2>Addendum to Privacy Policy for Republic of Korea</h2>
        <p>
          Unless mandated by law, consumer Personal Data is securely discarded
          without delay when (i) the consumer withdraws consent for our use of
          the information, (ii) the purpose of collecting and using the Personal
          Data is achieved, or (iii) the legal retention period concludes. If

          reuse. We will not share your Personal Data with third parties in a

          services provided in the Republic of Korea.
